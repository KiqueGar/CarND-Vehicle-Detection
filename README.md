# **Vehicle Detection Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier

## 1. HOG features and classifier.

First thing to try out was the use of different colorspaces, examples of
different channel separation for cars and not cars are located in
`output_images/colorspaces`.

As per visual examination, it seems like the YUV channel could be useful,
as it seems that car images have a greater dispertion than non cars, thus,
weÂ´re using said channel.

As per spatial features and histogram bins, trial and error were used as to
find the best balance between execution time and accuracy.

9 orientations on HOG features are being used, as fewer got more false
positives.

Code for colorspaces is located in "Color spaces for classification" section
of the `.ipynb`

Code for feature extraction can be found on section "Basic functions" on 
`.ipynb`

### 1.2. Classifier

Results for the feature extraction are normalized using a normalizaer as can
be seen here:

With this features, a SVM classifier is trained on section "Model and training"
inside `.ipynb`

## 2. Sliding Window

A sliding window search was used, 3 sizes of window were used: (64,64), (72,72) 
and (128,128) as to detect closer, mid range and farther away objects, search areas can be seen here:

Using the detector along the defined windows here are some examples of the pipeline:

As for dupictaes trimming, Non maximum supression (section "Sliding windows
and non maximum supression") is used, resulting in:

## 3. Video Implementation

## Discussion

The pipeline assumes a correct placement of the window search, in this case,
placement was sone manually, in the furute, center of lane can be used,
however, a bad placement will derive in faulty detections.

A buffer for heatmap calculation is used, this buffer takes 30 frames,
so this pieline will fail if sudden changes appear.
